**Spatial Reasoning** is fundamental to interacting within and navigating physical environments for embodied AI applications like robotics. However, data samples suitable for learning these capabilities are rare in AI pretraining datasets.
Don't be limited by what your model can do out-of-the-box, curate any image dataset from the Huggingface Hub for Spatial VQA with tools for scene understanding. 

VLMs trained using VQASynth üéπ 
* estimate 3D distances between objects in an image
* describe distances colloquially, convert between common units of measurement
* answer queries about the orientation and spatial relationships between objects
* base responses on consistent references like floors and surfaces

## Description

Fusing semantic and metric data into templated VQA chat, Vision Language Models can be instruction-tuned with low-rank adapters to enhance their baseline spatial reasoning capabilities. 
VQASynth üéπ provides an open-source reproduction of [SpatialVLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12168), which describes a 3D scene reconstruction pipeline and prompt templates for enhancing the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs including:

* Semantic filtering with [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) to normalize the image distribution and attributes
* Metric Depth Estimation with [ZoeDepth](https://github.com/isl-org/ZoeDepth) to lift the 2D image to 3D point cloud
* Object-level captioning with [FlexCap](https://flex-cap.github.io/) for precise 2D region proposal
* Plane-fitting with RANSAC for consistent 3D reference coordinates

Initial VQASynth üéπ pipelines prompted [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA) for JSON-formatted object-level detailed captions or tags using [RAM](https://github.com/xinyu1205/recognize-anything). Accordingly, we evaluated caption/tag based region proposal with publicly available models like [CLIPSeg](https://github.com/timojl/clipseg) and [groundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO).

## What's New üëÄ in VQASynth üéπ

ü™∂ Faster & lighter using [Florence-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06242) for detailed image captions **and** region proposal grounded on text captions.

üìê Improves metric depth estimation speed & accuracy by replacing ZoeDepth with [DepthPro](https://github.com/apple/ml-depth-pro).

üéì [SAM2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2) replaces SAM in the localization refinement stage.


### Environment

Before running the demo scripts, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10 or later
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [Docker Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/)
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)


## Run a Pipeline on Your Images

Use Docker Compose to transform Image datasets from Huggingface Hub into VQA datasets describing spatial relations between objects. 
You can process different datasets after updating the [config.yaml](config/config.yaml).

Then run the spatial VQA pipeline locally with Docker:

```bash
# Authenticate to push to hub
huggingface-cli login

# Run the pipeline
cd /path/to/VQASynth
bash run.sh
```
You can run the colab notebook using free-tier CPU or GPU acceleration or customize your own pipeline:
```python
from vqasynth.datasets import Dataloader
from vqasynth.embeddings import EmbeddingGenerator, TagFilter

dataloader = Dataloader(cache_dir)
dataset = dataloader.load_dataset(dataset_name)
embedding_generator = EmbeddingGenerator()
tag_filter = TagFilter()

include_tags = include_tags.strip().split(",")
exclude_tags = exclude_tags.strip().split(",")

# Extract embeddings
dataset = dataset.map(lambda example: embedding_generator.apply_transform(example, images))

# Extract tags
dataset = dataset.map(lambda example: tag_filter.apply_transform(example, include_tags + exclude_tags))

# Filter by tags
dataset_filtered = dataset.filter(
    lambda example: tag_filter.filter_by_tag(
        example['tag'], include_tags, exclude_tags
        )
    )
```

The resulting Huggingface dataset is in the cache directory and you can push to hub with:
```python
dataloader.push_to_hub(final_dataset, target_repo_name)
```

| Incorrect, the red forklift in warehouse is not on the left side of the brown cardboard boxes stacked. | The man in red hat walking is 60.13 centimeters from the wooden pallet with boxes. | Indeed, the man in blue shirt working is taller compared to the wooden pallet with boxes on floor. |
